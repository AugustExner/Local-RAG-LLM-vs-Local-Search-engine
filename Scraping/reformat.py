Tolkien\n is a reference book for the canon of \nMiddle-earth\n, compiled and written by \nRobert Foster\n, and now published by \nRandom House Publishing Group\n.\n\nOriginally released soon after the publication of \nThe Silmarillion\n, this book is generally recognised as an excellent reference book on the subject. However, as it excludes information on post-Silmarillion material (e.g., \nUnfinished Tales\n and the \nThe History of Middle-earth\n series\n), there a few errors.\n\nEditions\n[\n]\nThe book was first published as \nA Guide to Middle-earth\n in 1971, with paperback being released in 1973. In 1978, the title was emended to \nThe Complete Guide to Middle-earth: from The Hobbit to The Silmarillion. \nA revised edition was published by Del Rey in 2001, as well as an illustrated edition in 2003,Â in time for \nThe Lord of the Rings\n film trilogy\n.\n\nA 2022 edition was later released, with art by \nTed Nasmith\n.\n\nSee also\n[\n]\nA Companion to J.R.R.
